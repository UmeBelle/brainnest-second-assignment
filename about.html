					<h1><strong>Who are we?</strong></h1>
					<article>
						<p>
							We are an online library of free books. We provide free electronic
							books or ebooks. We are inspired by Project Gutenberg who invented
							ebooks in 1971 and we are still inspired by his creation till today.

					<h1>Our Mission statement</h1>
					<article>
						<p>
							Well Our Mission is simple: To encourage the creation and
							distribution of eBooks. <br />
							This mission is, as much as possible, to encourage all those who are
							interested in making eBooks and helping to give them away.In fact,
							We get approvals of about 99% of all requests from those who would
							like to make our eBooks and give them away, within their various
							local copyright limitations. <br />
							<br />
							We are powered by ideas, ideals, and by idealism. We are not powered
							by financial or political power. Because we are totally powered by
							volunteers we are hesitant to be very bossy about what our
							volunteers should do, or how to do it. We offer as many freedoms to
							our volunteers as possible, in choices of what books to do, what
							formats to do them in, or any other ideas they may have concerning
							“the creation and distribution of eBooks.” <br />
							<br />
							We are not in the business of establishing standards. If we were, we
							would have gladly accepted the request to convert an exemplary
							portion of our eBooks into HTML when World Wide Web was a brand new
							idea in 1993; we are happy to bring eBooks to our readers in as many
							formats as our volunteers wish to make. <br />
							<br />
							In addition, we do not provide standards of accuracy above those as
							recommended by institutions such as the U.S. Library of Congress at
							the level of 99.95%. While most of our eBooks exceed these standards
							and are presented in the most common formats, this is not a
							requirement; people are still encouraged to send us eBooks in any
							format and at any accuracy level and we will ask for volunteers to
							convert them to other formats, and to incrementally correct errors
							as times goes on. <br />
							<br />
							Many of our most popular eBooks started out with huge error levels
							only later did they come to the more polished levels seen today. In
							fact, many of our eBooks were done totally without any supervision
							by people who had never heard of us and only sent to us after the
							fact. We want to continue to encourage everyone to send us eBooks,
							even if they have already created some without any knowledge of who
							we were, what we were doing, or how we were doing it. <br />
							<br />
							We welcome everyone to contribute to our work.
